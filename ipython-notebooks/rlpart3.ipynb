    "###Learning Gridworld with Q-learning\n",
    "\n",
    "####Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "We've finally made it. We've made it to what we've all been waiting for, Q-learning with neural networks. Since I'm sure a lot of people didn't follow parts 1 and 2 because they were kind of boring, I will attempt to make this post relatively (but not completely) self-contained. In this post, we will dive into using Q-learning to train an agent (player) how to play Gridworld. Gridworld is a simple text based game in which there is a 4x4 grid of tiles and 4 objects placed therein: a player, pit, goal, and a wall. The player can move up/down/left/right ($a \\in A \\{up,down,left,right\\}$) and the point of the game is to get to the goal where the player will receive a numerical reward. Unfortunately, we have to avoid a pit, because if we land on the pit we are penalized with a negative 'reward'. As if our task wasn't difficult enough, there's also a wall that can block the player's path (but it offers no reward or penalty).\n",

    "A state is all the information necessary (e.g. pixel data in a game) to make a decision that you expect will take you to a new (higher value) state. The high level function of reinforcement learning is to learn the values of states or state-action pairs (the value of taking action $a$ given we're in state $s$). The value is some notion of how \"good\" that state or action is. Generally this is a function of rewards received now or in the future as a result of taking some action or being in some state.\n",
    "\n",
    "A policy, denoted $\\pi$, is the specific strategy we take in order to get into high value states or take high value actions to maximize our rewards over time. For example, a policy in blackjack might be to always hit until we have 19. We denote a function, $\\pi(s)$ that accepts a state $s$ and returns the action to be taken. Generally $\\pi(s)$ as a function just evaluates the value of all possible actions given the state $s$ and returns the highest value action. This will result in a specific policy $\\pi$ that may change over time as we improve our value estimates.\n",
    "\n",
    "We call the function that accepts a state $s$ and returns the value of that state $v_{\\pi}(s)$. This is the value function. Similarly, there is an action-value function $Q(s, a)$ that accepts a state $s$ and an action $a$ and returns the value of taking that action given that state. Some RL algorithms or implementations will use one or the other. Importantly, if we base our algorithm on learning state-values (as opposed to action-values), we must keep in mind that the value of a state depends completely on our policy $\\pi$. Using blackjack as an example, if we're in the state of having a card total of 20, and have two possible actions, hit or stay, the value of this state is only high if our policy says to stay when we have 20. If our policy said to hit when we have 20, we would probably bust and lose the game, thus the value of that state would be low. More formally, the value of a state is equivalent to the value of the highest action taken in that state."

    "#### What is Q-learning?\n",
    "\n",
    "Q-learning, like virtually all RL methods, is one type of algorithm used to calculate state-action values. It falls under the class of _temporal difference_ (TD) algorithms, which suggests that time differences between actions taken and rewards received are involved.\n",
    "\n",
    "In part 2 where we used a Monte Carlo method to learn to play blackjack, we had to wait until the end of a game (episode) to update our state-action values. With TD algorithms, we make updates after every action taken. In most cases, that makes more sense. We make a prediction (based on previous experience), take an action based on that prediction, receive a reward and then update our prediction.\n",
    "\n",
    "(Btw: Don't confuse the \"Q\" in Q-learning with the $Q$ function we've discussed in the previous parts. The $Q$ function is always the name of the function that accepts states and actions and spits out the value of that state-action pair. RL methods involve a $Q$ function but aren't necessarily Q-learning algorithms.)\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's the tabular Q-learning update rule:\n",
    "$$Q(S_t, A_t) \\leftarrow Q(S_t, A_t) + \\alpha[R_{t+1} + \\gamma maxQ(S_{t+1}, a_{t+1}) - Q(S_t, A_t)]$$\n",
    "\n",
    "So, like Monte Carlo, we could have a table that stores the Q-value for every possible state-action pair and iteratively update this table as we play games. Our policy $\\pi$ would be based on choosing the action with the highest Q value for that given state.\n",
    "\n",
    "But we're done with tables. This is 2015, we have GPUs and stuff. Well, as I alluded to in part 2, our $Q(s,a)$ function doesn't have to just be a lookup table. In fact, in most interesting problems, our state-action space is much too large to store in a table. Imagine a very simplified game of Pacman. If we implement it as a graphics-based game, the state would be the raw pixel data. In a tabular method, if the pixel data changes by just a single pixel, we have to store that as a completely separate entry in the table. Obviously that's silly and wasteful. What we need is some way to generalize and pattern match between states. We need our algorithm to say \"the value of these _kind_ of states is X\" rather than \"the value of this exact, super specific state is X.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "That's where neural networks come in. Or any other type of function approximator, even a simple linear model. We can use a neural network, instead of a lookup table, as our $Q(s,a)$ function. Just like before, it will accept a state and an action and spit out the value of that state-action.\n",
    "\n",
    "Importantly, however, unlike a lookup table, a neural network also has a bunch of parameters associated with it. These are the weights. So our $Q$ function actually looks like this: $Q(s, a, \\theta)$ where $\\theta$ is a vector of parameters. And instead of iteratively updating values in a table, we will iteratively update the $\\theta$ parameters of our neural network so that it learns to provide us with better estimates of state-action values.\n",
    "\n",
    "Of course we can use gradient descent (backpropagation) to train our $Q$ neural network just like any other neural network.\n",
    "\n",
    "But what's our target `y` vector (expected output vector)? Since the net is not a table, we don't use the formula shown above, our target is simply: $r_{t+1} + \\gamma * maxQ(s', a')$ for the state-action that just happened. $\\gamma$ is a parameter $0\\rightarrow1$ that is called the _discount factor_. Basically it determines how much each future reward is taken into consideration for updating our Q-value. If $\\gamma$ is close to 0, we heavily discount future rewards and thus mostly care about immediate rewards.  $s'$ refers to the new state after having taken action $a$ and $a'$ refers to the next actions possible in this new state. So $maxQ(s', a')$ means we calculate all the Q-values for each state-action pair in the new state, and take the maximium value to use in our new value update. (Note I may use $s' \\text{ and } a'$ interchangeably with $s_{t+1} \\text{ and } a_{t+1}$.)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "One important note: our reward update for every state-action pair is $r_{t+1} + \\gamma*maxQ(s_{t+1}, a)$ __except__ when the state $s'$ is a terminal state. When we've reached a terminal state, the reward update is simply $r_{t+1}$. A terminal state is the last state in an episode. In our case, there are 2 terminal states: the state where the player fell into the pit (and receives -10) and the state where the player has reached the goal (and receives +10). Any other state is non-terminal and the game is still in progress.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two keywords I need to mention as well: __on-policy__ and __off-policy__ methods. In on-policy methods we iteratively learn about state values at the same time that we improve our policy. In other words, the updates to our state values depend on the policy. In contrast, off-policy methods do not depend on the policy to update the value function. Q-learning is an off-policy method. It's advantageous because with off-policy methods, we can follow one policy while learning about another. For example, with Q-learning, we could always take completely random actions and yet we would still learn about another policy function of taking the best actions in every state. If there's ever a $\\pi$ referenced in the value update part of the algorithm then it's an on-policy method."

    "Before we get too deep into the neural network Q-learning stuff, let's discuss the Gridworld game implementation that we're using as our toy problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "We're going to implement 3 variants of the game in order of increasing difficulty. The first version will initialize a grid in exactly the same way each time. That is, every new game starts with the player (P), goal (+), pit (-), and wall (W) in exactly the same positions. Thus the algorithm just needs to learn how to take the player from a known starting position to a known end position without hitting the pit, which gives out negative rewards.\n",
    "\n",
    "The second implementation is slightly more difficult. The goal, pit and wall will always be initialized in the same positions, but the player will be placed randomly on the grid on each new game. The third implementation is the most difficult to learn, and that's where all elements are randomly placed on the grid each game.\n",

    "The state is a 3-dimensional numpy array (4x4x4). You can think of the first two dimensions as the positions on the board; e.g. row 1, column 2 is the position (1,2) [zero indexed] on the board. The 3rd dimension encodes the object/element at that position. Since there are 4 different possible objects, the 3rd dimension of the state contains vectors of length 4. We're using a one-hot encoding for the elements except that the empty position is just a vector of all zeros. So with a 4 length vector we're encoding 5 possible options at each grid position: empty, player, goal, pit, or wall.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can also think of the 3rd dimension as being divided into 4 separate grid planes, where each plane represents the position of each element.

    "Now for the fun part. Let's build our neural network that will serve as our $Q$ function. Since this is a post about Q-learning, I'm not going to code a neural network from scratch. I'm going to use the fairly popular Theano-based library Keras. You can of course use whatever library you want, or roll your own.\n",

    "__Important Note__:\n",
    "Up until now, I've been talking about how the neural network can serve the role of $Q(s, a)$, and that's absolutely true. However, I will be implementing our neural network in the same way that Google DeepMind did for its Atari playing algorithm. Instead of a neural network architecture that accepts a state and an action as inputs and outputs the value of that single state-action pair, DeepMind built a network that just accepts a state and outputs separate Q-values for each possible action in its output layer. This is pretty clever because in Q-learning we need to get the $maxQ(s', a')$ [max of the Q values for every possible action in the new state s']. Rather than having to run our network forward for every action, we just need to run it forward once. The result is the same, however, it's just more efficient.\n",

    "###Playing the the harder variant, catastrophic forgetting, and experience replay\n",
    "\n",
    "We're slowly building up our chops and we want our algorithm to train on the harder variant of the game where every new game the player is randomly placed on the grid. It can't just memorize a sequence of steps to take as before, it needs to be able to take the shortest path to the goal (without stepping into the pit) from wherever it starts on the grid. It needs to develop a slightly more sophisticated representation of its environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "Unfortunately, there is a problem we may need to deal with as our problem becomes increasingly more difficult. There is a known problem called __catastrophic forgetting__ that is associated with gradient descent based training methods in online training. \n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine that in game \\#1 that our algorithm is training on (learning Q-values for) the player is placed in between the pit and the goal such that the goal is on the right and the pit is on the left. Using epsilon-greedy strategy, the player takes a random move and by chance takes a step to the right and hits the goal. Great, the algorithm will try to learn that this state-action pair is associated with a high reward by updating its weights in such a way that the output will more closely match the target value (i.e backpropagation). Now, the second game gets initialized and the player is again in between the goal and pit but this time the goal is on the _left_ and the pit is on the right. Perhaps to our naive algorithm, the state _seems_ very similar to the last game.  Let's say that again, the player chooses to make one step to the right, but this time it ends up in the pit and gets -10 reward. The player is thinking \"what the hell I thought going to the right was the best decision based on my previous experience.\" So now it may do backpropagation again to update its state-action value but because this state-action is very similar to the last learned state-action it may mess up its previously learned weights. \n",
    "\n",
    "This is the essence of catastrophic forgetting. There's a push-pull between very similar state-actions (but with divergent targets) that results in this inability to properly learn anything. We generally don't have this problem in the supervised learning realm because we do randomized batch learning, where we don't update our weights until we've iterated through some random subset of our training data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Catastrophic forgetting is probably not something we have to worry about with the first variant of our game because the targets are always stationary; but with the harder variants, it's something we should consider, and that is why I'm implementing something called __experience replay__. Experience replay basically gives us minibatch updating in an online learning scheme. It's actually not a huge deal to implement; here's how it works.\n",
    "\n",
    "Experience replay:\n",
    "1. In state $s$, take action $a$, observe new state $s_{t+1}$ and reward $r_{t+1}$\n",
    "2. Store this as a tuple $(s, a, s_{t+1}, r_{t+1})$ in a list.\n",
    "3. Continue to store each experience in this list until we have filled the list to a specific length (up to you to define)\n",
    "4. Once the experience replay memory is filled, randomly select a subset (e.g. 40)\n",
    "5. Iterate through this subset and calculate value updates for each; store these in a target array (e.g. `y_train`) and store the state $s$ of each memory in `X_train`\n",
    "6. Use `X_train` and `y_train` as a minibatch for batch training. For subsequent epochs where the array is full, just overwrite old values in our experience replay memory array.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, in addition to learning the action-value for the action we just took, we're also going to use a random sample of our past experiences to train on to prevent catastrophic forgetting.\n",
    "\n",
    "So here's the same training algorithm from above except with experience replay added. Remember, this time we're training it on the harder variant of the game where the player is randomly placed on the grid."

    "\n",
    "Okay, I lied. I will not be showing you the algorithm learning the hardest variant of the game (where all 4 elements are randomly placed on the grid each game). I'm leaving that up to you to attempt and let me know how it goes via email (outlacedev@gmail.com). The reason is, I'm doing all this on a Macbook Air (read: no CUDA gpu) and thus I cannot train the algorithm to a sufficiently large number of epochs for it to learn the problem. I suspect it may require significantly more epochs, perhaps more than 50,000. So if you have an nVIDIA GPU and can train it that long, let me know if it works. I could have used Lua/Torch7 since there is an OpenCL version but no one would read this if it wasn't in Python =P.\n",
    "\n",
    "###Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "There you have it, basic Q-learning using neural networks.\n",
    "\n",
    "That was a lot to go through, hopefully I didn't make too many mistakes (as always, email if you spot any so I can post corrections). I'm hoping you have success training Q-learning algorithms on more interesting problems than the gridworld game.\n",
    "\n",
    "I'd say this is definitely the climax of the series on reinforcement learning. I plan to release a part 4 that will be about other temporal difference learnings algorithms that use eligibility traces. Since that's a relatively minor new concept, I will likely use it on another toy problem like gridworld. However, I do, at some point, want to release a post about setting up and using the Arcade Learning Environment (ALE) [fmr. Atari Learning Environment] and training an alogorithm to play Atari games, however, that will likely be a long while from now so don't hold your breath.\n",
