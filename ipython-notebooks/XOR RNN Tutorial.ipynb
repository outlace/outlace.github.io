    "This blog is my journey into learning the fundamentals of machine learning and other quantitative principles and applications and is generally in chronological order of my learning. After I successfully learned how to make feedforward neural networks and train them, I really wanted to learn how to make recurrent neural networks (RNNs). I understood that they were for temporal/sequential data and thus they could learn relationships through time. But I could not for the life of me figure out how to make the jump from a feedforward neural net to an RNN until I watched this youtube video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2sGq_vI41s (which I highly suggest you watch) by Jeff Heaton. Then I understood that RNNs can be implemented almost exactly like an ordinary feedforward neural network. I will re-explain some of the contents of that video here as I build a simple recurrent (Elman) neural network to solve a temporal version of the XOR problem (my favorite toy problem). I will also show you how to do basic time series/sequence prediction with a mini-mini-char-RNN implementation."

    "<p>You don't really need to understand the code behind this graph. Essentially what I'm doing is taking the set of optimal weights returned from the optimization function, and then changing the third weight (arbitrarily chosen) in the unrolled weight vector to between the values of -1 to -10 and calculating the cost for each new set of weights (but of the 29 total weights, only one individual weight is changed). So we're only looking at the cost as a function of <b>1</b> individual weight. The graph looks different if you look at a different weight, but the point is, this is not a nice cost surface. If our initial weight lands somewhere left of 6, then we'll probably be able to gradient descent down to the minimum, but if it lands to the right, we'll probably get stuck in that local minimum. Now imagine all 29 weights in our network having a cost surface like this and you can see how it gets ugly. <b>The take-away here is that RNNs have a lot of local optima that make it really difficult to train with the typical methods we use in feedforward networks.</b> Ideally, we want a cost function that is smooth and convex.\n",

    "What's \"mini, mini, mini char-RNN\" ? If you're familiar with Karpathy's charRNN (http://karpathy.github.io/2015/05/21/rnn-effectiveness/) then you'll have an idea. We're going to build the simple RNN that predicts the next character in a short word like \"hello\" as presented on his blog. We're just going to modify the RNN we built above with a few key changes:\n",
    "\n",
    "1) There is no longer a distinct Y vector of expected values. Our expected values are the next character in the sequence. So if we feed our RNN 'hell' we expect it to return 'ello' to complete the word we trained it on. So $y = X[j+1, :]$.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2) Since we have only have 4 characters in our \"vocabularly\", we'll represent them as binary vectors of length 4. I.e. our binary encoding (arbitrarily assigned) is: `h = [0 0 1 0], e = [0 1 0 0], l = [0 0 0 1], o = [1 0 0 0]`\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "3) We're going to expand the hidden layer from 4 to 10. Seems to make training faster.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "4) Thus the input layer will now contain: 4 inputs + 10 context units + 1 bias = 11 total. And the output will contain  4 units since each letter is a vector of length 4."

    "<p>If you want to take this farther, try increasing the number of characters you can encode by increasing the input and output layers. I tried (not shown here) up to 11 element vectors, using the letters \"e t a o i n s h r d\" (which are the top 10 highest frequency letters in english) and the space character. With just those 11 characters you can encode alot of words, even sentences. While I got it to work on individual words, training became increasingly difficult for longer input sequences (I tried expanding the hidden layer). My guess is that it just doesn't have enough 'memory' to remember more than a couple of characters back, therefore it won't be able to learn the character sequences of a long word or sentence. Hence why anyone doing 'real' character prediction (like the Karpathy charRNN) uses a much more sophisticated RNN, an LSTM network.</p>\n",

    "I also attempted to build a character generator from this code, so that we train it on a word or small sentence and then tell it to generate some sequence of characters based on a seed/starting character or word. That didn't work well enough to present here, but if I get it working, I'll make a new post.\n",

    "<p>Also, like I mentioned before, I had to resort to using a scipy optimizer to help train the network rather than use my own implementation of gradient descent like I did with the normal feedforward XOR network in my previous post. I suppose I was experiencing the exploding/vanishing gradient problem and I just didn't have a sophisticated enough gradient descent implementation. If you have any expertise to lend here then please email me (outlacedev@gmail.com). And please email me if you spot any errors.</p>"
