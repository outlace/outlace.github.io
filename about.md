Hi, I'm Brandon. I'm a self-taught programmer and current medical student.
Although I spend most of my time learning medical stuff these days, I've always had a
strong interest in machine learning and artificial intelligence. Unfortunately,
I don't have a very quantitative background (I majored in Neuroscience in college)
so I'm attempting to teach myself the fundamentals and will share my journey on this blog.
My dream career would involve the combination of medicine and machine learning; hopefully I can pull it off one day.
