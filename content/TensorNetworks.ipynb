    "__Abstract__: Tensor Networks can be seen as a higher-order generalization of traditional deep neural networks, and yet they lack an explicit non-linearity such as applying the ReLU or sigmoid function as we do with neural nets. In this article, we cover a different perspective on what linearity vs nonlinearity means by treating function arguments as \"resources\" that can be consumed. Linear functions are those that \"conserve resources\" (i.e. they don't copy or delete their inputs). \n",
    "\n",
    "We then cover what tensor networks are, how they work, and how this different notion of linearity gives insight into how tensor networks can learn non-linear transformations. We demonstrate that while tensor networks are locally linear, they can exhibit global non-linear behavior due to the action of copying input data and inpendently transforming each copy. Hence, unlike neural networks, the non-linearity of tensor networks arises soley from the architecture and topology of the network itself. Lastly, we demonstrate how a simple tensor network can perform reasonably well on the FashionMNIST dataset using PyTorch's `einsum` function.\n",

Together the linear transformation and the non-linear function are called a \"layer\" of the network, and the composition of many layers forms a deep neural network. Both the depth and the non-linearity of deep neural networks are crucial for their generalizability and learning power.\n",
    "\n",
    "The most credible explanation for why depth matters in neural networks is that depth models hierarchy, i.e. the idea that some data are at a higher and lower levels of abstraction. \"My Jack Terrier dog Spot\" is a concrete instance of the more abstract concept of \"dog\" or even \"animal.\" Hence depth naturally models these kinds of hierarchical relationships in data, and it turns out pretty much all of the data we care about has a hierarchical structure (e.g. letters -> words -> sentences, or musical notes -> chords -> bars -> songs). Another word for hierarchy is composition; complex things are often composed of simpler things, which are composed of yet simpler things. Hence _deep_ neural networks have an (inductive) bias toward learning these compositional/hierarchical relationships, which is exactly what we want them to do."

Quite literally, we're transforming some geometric shape (or space) into a different shape. The task of the neural network then is to figure how to construct a new shape (the output/target space) from a starting shape (the input data point cloud) using only the tools of affine transformations and (usually) a single type of non-linear function, such as the rectified linear unit (ReLU) or sigmoid."

    "One interesting path is information theory. If you have a non-linear function like $f(x) = x^2$, it is non-linear because $x$ is copied. However, consider a function like $f(x,y) = x*y$, it is called multi-linear because it is linear with respect to each of its input variables. Interestingly, if $y = x$ (always) then this function behaves exactly like f(x)=x^2 but it's just in a different form. More generally, if $f(x,y) = x*y$ but y is merely correlated with x, say $y = x + e$ (e = noise) then you'll get f(x,y) = x(x+e) = x^2 + ex, which for a sufficiently small $e$ will behave nearly the same as f(x) = x^2. So just a linear function of two variables that are highly correlated will produce non-linear behavior. Hence, if you have say two separate_linear_ dynamic systems that start off completely un-entangeled with each having their own maximum degrees of freedom, if they start to become correlated/entangled with each other by interaction, then when taken together as a composite system, it may exhibit non-linear dynamics."

    "It worked! Well approximately. It's not exactly computing ReLU, but close enough, it's more like it learned how to square the numbers. In any case, the important thing is that it is definitely performing a non-linear function. There is no linear function that can only flip the sign of negative numbers and leave the sign of positive numbers alone. And if you tried this same training task using the \"_linear_ topology\" from the diagram on the right above, you would be completely unable to learn this non-linear function no matter how you tune the hyperparameters and no matter how big the tensors are. The wiring is everything. The non-linearity arises from the network structure (global) not the individual tensor contractions (locally linear).\n",

Yet it is not that surprising once you understand that no-cloning perspective of linearity. With the right wiring together of tensors, we can allow the tensor computations to return copies of input data, transform each copy independently, then pool together the result. That's how we get non-linearity. Indeed, it has been shown that certain kinds of tensor networks are directly related to convolutional neural networks with max pooling, see < https://arxiv.org/abs/1603.00162 >\n",

You can design tree networks, grid networks, or any topology you can think of as long as the contractions are possible.\n",

Well, tensor networks arose in the Physics community as a powerful tool to simulate quantum systems, so they're definitely useful in that domain. Unfortunately the jury is still out on whether they're \"better\" than neural networks. Is there an advantage to imposing non-linearity from network topology alone, or is it more efficient to just include an activation function? \n",

    "So far, I can't tell either from my own experiments with tensor networks or from the literature. However, because the components of tensor networks, tensors, are just high-order structured data, they have shown to be much more interpretable as parameters than the weights of a neural network that get rammed through activation functions. One small benefit I've noticed (but take it with a big grain of salt) is that I can use a much higher learning rate with a tensor network than a neural network without causing divergence during training.\n",

The reason for using a linear tensor network is mostly because a decently sized tensor network with non-linear topology (e.g. a hierarchical tree like the figure in the beginning of the post) would be too much code, and a bit too confusing to read with raw einsum notation. \n",

    "Unfortunately, this non-linear tensor network performs significantly better with the training data (getting over 94% accuracy at 50 epochs) but the test accuracy tops out at around 88%, similar to the linear network. This just demonstrates that with the added non-linear ability, we can much more easily overfit the data. One thing to try is to add trainable bias tensors into the network as we have in neural networks."

    "Tensor Networks can be seen as a generalization of neural networks where the non-linearity arises purely out of the network topology as a manifestation of copying data, and not by a particular choice of non-linear activation function. They can be used just about anywhere a neural network can be (albeit with unproven performance) and tensor decompositions offer a powerful way to learn features from data. Tensor Networks are being actively studied and improved and I believe it is likely they will be a great tool in your machine learning toolkit."
